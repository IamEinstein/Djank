# Djank, django bank

Djank is a bank made using django.

It's an open source project available on github and has been dpeloyed to Heroku.

## What is djank all about ?
Djank is just an open source project made by a group of students in order to learn python. It's aim is to integrate a website with a discord bot and a mobile app made using react-native.

## How to use djank
Well, it's simple, just head on to the [website](https://djank.herokuapp.com) and sign up.
You'll have a default bank balance of $100 (Remember the money is fake!!!!!).
Now u can perform transactions - add or withdraw money, see your transaction history once you've performed some transactions, and change your password 

Spoiler :  Soon, you'll also be able to transfer money to other accounts.

## Discord bot 
As for the bot, it's in the process of being made, we're brining new features to it regularly. You can know more about the bot [here](https://fun-bot-discord.github.io/fun-bot-website/) and [invite it in your server](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=819212547449290794&scope=bot&permissions=2147483647). The prefix for the bot is `f!`


## Mobile app
The mobile app, as of now, is still under development. We've started working on it and will be rolling it out soon. Until then, feel free to use our website on your mobile
